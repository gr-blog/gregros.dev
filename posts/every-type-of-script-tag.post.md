There used to be just one type of script tag, but after decades of web standards development, we have tons of them.

Let’s take a look at every single one!

# Two categories
I like to divide script tags based on two primary classifications.

1. The **type axis**, which describes **how a script tag executes.**
2. The **source axis**, which says **where it gets its content from**.

We can picture this using a simple tabular diagram:
```canva size=445x305 ;; key=script-tag-types ;; alt=Script tag types diagram
https://www.canva.com/design/DAGby5He9jU/1PyY3PGdsH74HG0GVjaimA/view?utm_content=DAGby5He9jU&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link2&utm_source=uniquelinks&utlId=h43df53d6b0
```
# Type axis
There are three possible options here, and they’re all determined by the script’s `type` attribute.

- **Non-executable** script tags.
- **Classic** script tags
- **Module** script tags

Let’s take a closer look at each one.
## Non-executable
You’ll get this kind of script tag if your `type` is present but **doesn’t** have one of the recognized values for executable scripts:

- A JavaScript MIME type — `"text/javascript"`
- Module — `"module"`
- No value or the empty string `""`

These script tags won’t execute and won’t fetch any resources. Instead, they’re used to embed data into the page through the body of the tag, usually in the form of JSON. 

It’s best practice to use the `type` attribute to indicate the type of data it contains.

Some common values for the attribute include:

- `"application/json"`
- `"application/yaml"`
- `"application/xml"`

In principle, you could use any HTML tag for this purpose, but script tags have several advantages over other types of tags.

- They are invisible.
- They can appear in the `<head>` portion of the page. 
- They let you avoid escaping most special characters used in HTML, like `&` and `<`.

Here is an example of a non-executable script tag:

```html
<!-- a non-executable script tag -->
<script type="application/json">
  {
    "analytics": true,
    "options": {
      "theme": "no",
      "antigravity": "ǝnɹʇ",
      "lasers": "pew pew",
      "foo": "bar",
      "canBeHacked": false
    }
  }
</script>
```

## Module
You’ll get this kind of script tag if you have the `type` attribute set to `"module"`. 

These script tags are entrypoints to the ES module system. They always fetch and execute asynchronously.

Here are a few examples of ES module script tags of different kinds:

```html
<!-- An inline module script tag -->
<script type="module">
  import { myFunction } from './module.js'
  myFunction()
</script>

<!-- an external module script tag -->
<script 
  type="module" 
  src="https://example.com/module.js"
></script>

<!-- a data module script tag -->
<script 
  type="module"
  src="data:text/javascript,import './module.js'"
>
</script>
```

### The new normal for the web
Nowadays, pretty much everyone uses module script tags. 

While porting old code that uses classic script tags can be a thorny proposition, you should absolutely use these if you’re building something new.

One drawback they do have is **compatibility.** They’ve been supported by major browsers since around 2017, but some users continue to use obsolete browsers that don’t support them. 

This includes the infamous IE11, but also some built-in mobile browsers.

Overall, these browsers account for up to 5% of active users, but this percentage can be much lower or much higher, depending on the specific demographics your product is targeting. 

If you’re, say, writing a tech blog, it’s not something you have to worry about. But a government service, a pension fund, or a bank might have stricter requirements.
## Classic
You’ll get this kind of script tag if the `type` attribute:

- Doesn’t exist
- Has a value of `text/javascript` or another valid JavaScript MIME type.
- Has no value, or the value `""`.

Classic script tags have been around since JavaScript became a thing, and they make up the majority of script tags found on websites today. 

In spite of their age – or perhaps because of it – they are actually more complicated than the newer module type script tags.

When the browser encounters a classic script tag as part of parsing a webpage, it will immediately fetch and execute its content synchronously, blocking the rest of the page from loading until it’s done. 

This means that some or all of the page might not have loaded yet when the script executes.

For instance, if you place the script before the `<body>` tag, you’ll find `document.body` to be `null`. If you place it before a `<div>`, that `<div>` won’t exist yet. 

Some elements, such as images and fonts, can be loaded asynchronously, which means the script might execute while the geometry of the page hasn’t settled yet, changing the results of functions such as `getClientRect`.

Any top-level declarations made here will become page-wide globals, accessible from any other script tag. 

This is a particularly nasty and error-prone feature, and you’ll frequently see script tags use scoping constructs like self-executing functions in order to control it.

Here is an example of a script tag using this technique:

```html
<!-- a classic inline script tag 
     using the 'self-executing function'
     technique 
-->
<script>
  (function() {
    const myDiv = document.createElement('div')
    myDiv.textContent = 'Hello, world!'
    document.body.appendChild(myDiv)
  })()
</script>
```

Here are examples of different kinds of classic script tags:

```html
 <!-- external classic script tag -->
<script 
  src="https://example.com/script.js"
></script>

<!-- inline classic script tag -->
<script> 
  alert(1) 
</script> 

<!-- data classic script tag -->
<script 
  src="data:text/javascript,alert(1)"
></script> 

<!-- with type attribute -->
<script 
  src="https://example.com/script.js" 
  type="text/javascript"
></script>

<!-- another one -->
<script 
  src="https://example.com/script.js" 
  type=""
></script>
```
### Client-side infrastructure
The ES module system has replaced classic script tags for frontend development, but that doesn’t mean classic script tags are now obsolete.

Instead, they’ve simply transformed into a specialized tool for low-level applications. While in the previous section I phrased it as a drawback, the ability to choose exactly when your code will execute is actually very powerful.

For example, classic script tags that appear before the `<body>` tag will execute before any visible component of the page has loaded, which guarantees the user hasn’t had the chance to interact with anything yet.

This technique is crucial for many pieces of client-side infrastructure, ranging from analytics packages to security systems, which must come online early to avoid missing security threats or events.

That doesn’t mean they get a free pass to block the page for as long as they like, though. 

Rather, this power comes with the responsibility of ensuring as little disruption to the page as possible. If a security system blocks for too long, hurts user experience, and causes clients to lose KPIs — they will simply switch to something else.
# Source axis
The source axis determines where a script’s JavaScript content comes from. This axis has four possibilities:

- **Inline scripts**, which get their JavaScript contents from the element’s body.
- **External scripts**, which reference a script file by address.
- **Data scripts**, which use a URI with the `data:` pseudo-protocol.
- **Blob scripts**, which use a URI with the `blob:` pseudo-protocol.

The group a script belongs to is determined by its `src` attribute.
## Inline scripts
These kinds of scripts don’t have an `src` attribute and embed JavaScript content in the body of the tag. 

The browser has special rules for parsing the bodies of script tags. These rules let you avoid escaping special characters like `&` or `<`. However, it’s not like the HTML parser tries to parse JavaScript either.

Instead, it simply looks for the string `</script>` and closes the tag as soon as it finds it. It doesn’t matter if it appears in the middle of JavaScript code, as part of a string, or in a JavaScript comment.

So, for example, the following content will cause the script to break:

```html
<script type="module">
  const script2 = "<script>alert(1)</script>"
  //            parsing fails here ↑
</script>  
```

Here are examples of valid inline script tags:

```html
<!-- classic inline script tag -->
<script> 
	alert(1) 
</script>

<!-- module inline script tag -->
<script type="module"> 
	import { myFunction } from './module.js' 
</script>
```
## External script
These scripts have an `src` attribute that points to an HTTP/S URL.

When compared to inline scripts, external scripts have a number of advantages that make them the most common type of script tag in use today.

1. They let you avoid sending the same bit of JavaScript with every request, leveraging the browser’s caching mechanism and reducing overall bandwidth.
2. They have an address that will appear in the stack trace, making them far easier to debug. 
3. They mean you can use different hosting strategies for different parts of your site, optimizing delivery and potentially reducing costs.
4. They allow for better code organization.

The main disadvantage they have against inline scripts is the extra indirection, which increases latency, at least on the first page load. Whether they are more or less secure than inline scripts is a thorny question that’s hard to answer.

Here are some examples of external script tags:

```html
<!-- classic external script -->
<script 
  src="https://example.com/script.js"
></script>

<!-- module external script -->
<script 
  type="module" 
  src="https://example.com/module.js"
></script>
```
## Data scripts
Data scripts have an `src` attribute that points to a URI that uses the `data:` pseudo-protocol.

As a pseudo-protocol, `data:` doesn’t actually point to the location of a resource. Instead, this pseudo-protocol lets you embed content verbatim into the URI itself, and have the browser load that content as though it came from the network.

`data:` URIs are extremely handy for many purposes, and you’ll occasionally see scripts loaded this way. These kinds of scripts should be compared with inline scripts, rather than external scripts, since they embed JavaScript content instead of referencing another resource.

Data scripts use more consistent escaping rules than inline tags, and can use a wide variety of encodings and character sets, which are often specified as part of the data URI. One of the most popular options is base64, which avoids the need to escape anything.

At the same time, data scripts have the massive disadvantage of usually being illegible. This makes them one of the vectors of choice when attackers inject malicious scripts. 

Here are some examples of data script tags in action:

```html
<!-- classic data script tag -->
<script 
  src="data:text/javascript,alert(1)"
></script>

<!-- classic base64 encoded data script tag -->
<script 
  src="data:text/javascript;base64,YWxlcnQoMSk="
></script>

<!-- classic base64+utf8 encoded data script tag -->
<script 
  src="data:text/javascript;charset=UTF-8;base64,YWxlcnQoMSk="
></script>

<!-- module data script tag -->
<script 
  type="module"
  src="data:text/javascript,import './module.js'"
></script>
```
## Blob scripts
Blob scripts can only be created from JavaScript. They’re pretty weird.

In JavaScript, a Blob is kind of like a Stream. It represents a bunch of data, without specifying its source or shape.

You can get Blobs as the result of `fetch` requests or from files uploaded by the user, but they can also be created explicitly using the `Blob` constructor, like this:

```ts
var blob = new Blob(
  ['alert(1)'], 
  { 
    type: 'text/javascript' 
  }
)
```

You can then use `URL.createObjectURL` to get a URI with the `blob:` pseudo-protocol. Again, being a pseudo-protocol, it doesn’t point to a location of a resource. In this case, the URI points to the dynamically allocated blob.

This URI looks something like this:

```js
`blob:http://localhost:1234/60e5ba14-5bd0-4333-bb19-7782bf17cf4a`
```

There are solid reasons to use these, though I have to admit they’re pretty weird. 

Because they must be constructed using JavaScript, they can’t be inserted using certain kinds of XSS attacks. This makes them somewhat more secure than `data:` URI.

However, they have some security risks too. They are sometimes used by attackers to obfuscate malicious scripts, since they’re harder to trace.

Here is some code that creates a script tag using this kind of URI:

```js
// Construct the blob
var blob = new Blob(
  ['alert(1)'], 
  { 
    type: 'text/javascript' 
  }
)
// Generate a blob URI for it
var uri = URL.createObjectURL(blob)

// Create a new script tag
var script = document.createElement('script')

// Set its src to the URI
script.src = uri

// Insert it into the page
document.body.appendChild(script)
```

The resulting script tag looks like this:

```html
<script 
	src="blob:http://localhost:1234/60e5ba14-5bd0-4333-bb19-7782bf17cf4a"
></script>
```

# Conclusion
Decades of development have given us a huge range of script tags of different types. There is a lot more I didn’t have the time to cover, of course, and I hope you’ll join me on future deep dives into the subject.
